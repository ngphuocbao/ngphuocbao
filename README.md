I’m a senior student at the University of Science, Vietnam National University – Ho Chi Minh City, majoring in Electronics and Telecommunications, with an unwavering passion for RTL design, FPGA implementation, and the ASIC design flow.
For me, digital design is more than just code and schematics—it’s about transforming abstract logic into real, working systems that push the limits of performance and reliability.

Over my academic journey, I have:

  Built from scratch a fully functional 64-bit Timer IP core in Verilog, APB 3.0-compliant, with modular design, interrupt handling, and automated simulation on a remote Linux server.

  Implemented a Square Multiplier Block using the ancient Vedic algorithm (Urdhva Tiryakbhyam) on FPGA, applying a hierarchical design approach for efficiency and scalability.

  Gained hands-on experience across the entire digital IC workflow—from RTL coding and functional verification to FPGA deployment—while constantly optimizing for performance.

Core Skills:
  Verilog HDL | RTL Design & Verification | FPGA Implementation (Intel Quartus, Altera DE2) | APB/AHB Protocols | Testbench Development | ModelSim | Synopsys VCS/DVE | Design Compiler | Linux (MobaXterm)

I’m always ready to collaborate on open-source IC design projects, tackle challenging verification problems, and craft IP cores that make a difference. My goal? To grow into a Digital Design Engineer who blends creativity, precision, and innovation in every project.
