👋 Hi, I’m Bao Nguyen Phuoc

🎓 Graduated from the University of Science, Vietnam National University – Ho Chi Minh City

📚 Major in Electronics and Telecommunications | Focus on RTL Design & IC Design

I’m passionate about digital design—transforming abstract logic into real, high-performance systems through RTL coding, FPGA implementation, and the ASIC design flow. My expertise lies in developing and verifying digital IP cores, optimizing for both performance and reliability, and working with industry-standard simulation tools.

🚀 Key Projects
64-bit Timer IP Core (Verilog, APB 3.0) – Designed from scratch with modular architecture, interrupt handling, and automated simulation on a remote Linux server.

Square Multiplier Block – Implemented using the Vedic algorithm (Urdhva Tiryakbhyam) on FPGA with a hierarchical design approach for efficiency and scalability.

🛠 Core Skills
Verilog HDL | RTL Design & Verification | FPGA Implementation (Intel Quartus, Altera DE2) | APB/AHB Protocols | Testbench Development | ModelSim | Synopsys VCS/DVE | Design Compiler | Linux (MobaXterm)

🌟 What I’m Looking For
I’m eager to collaborate on open-source IC design projects, contribute to RTL-based IP core development, and take on new challenges in functional verification and digital system optimization.
