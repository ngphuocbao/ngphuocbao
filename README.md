WELCOME TO MY GITHUB PROFILE !!!

ðŸ”¥ Hi, Iâ€™m Bao Nguyen Phuoc - A senior at the University of Science   
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in integrated circuit design, especially RTL design and functional verification.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced techniques in ASIC/FPGA design, focusing on APB/AHB protocols, testbench development, and simulation tools like ModelSim.  
ðŸ’• Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source IC design projects or contribute to RTL-based IP core development.  
ðŸ“« How to reach me: npbao1404@gmail.com  
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him  
âš¡ Fun fact: I once built and verified a 64-bit APB Timer IP core from scratch using Verilog and simulated it entirely on a remote Linux server!
